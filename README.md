## Description

_Epicodus Intro to Programming Week 3 independent project. Created a Ping Pong game webpage but changed it to "Peanut Butter and Jelly". With the use of JavaScript, jQuery, loops and branching with if/else statements in a for loop the user may input a number. The numbers will be counted out from 1 to the input number. Numbers evenly divisible by 3 return "Peanut Butter", numbers divisible by 5 return "Jelly" and if divisible by both numbers it returns "Peanut Butter and Jelly!" otherwise it just returns the number._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Visit http://ashleyraymaceli.github.io/ping-pong/ to see site in action_

## Known Bugs

_If user picks a large number, the user must scroll all the way back to the top to press the Play Again button_
_One if/else statement in user interface logic to alert user if what they are entering is NaN or a negative number. When added to the business logic it would continue through to the result page. By putting it in the user interface logic it will stop the program before it gets to the main function. Main function is still created in business logic and called on in user interface logic._
