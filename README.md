## Description

_Epicodus Intro to Programming Week 3 independent project. Created a ping pong game webpage. With the use of JavaScript, jQuery, loops and branching with if/else statements based on the user's input number, the numbers will be counted out to the input number. Numbers evenly divisibly by 3 return "ping", numbers divisibly by 5 return "pong" and if divisibly by both numbers it returns "ping pong" otherwise it just returns the number._
